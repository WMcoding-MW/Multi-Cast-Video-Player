Purpose
This document defines the product requirements for a web application that enables users to watch multiple YouTube videos simultaneously. The application leverages the YouTube IFrame Player API to dynamically embed and control multiple video streams. The goal is to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users who want to view and manage multiple videos on a single screen.
Scope
The web app will:
Allow users to add YouTube videos dynamically.
Support multiple video playback on the same page.
Offer basic playback controls for each video.
Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

User stories
US-001: Add a video to the interface
Description: As a user, I want to add a YouTube video by entering a URL or video ID so that I can watch it within the app. Acceptance criteria:
The user enters a valid YouTube video ID or URL.
The video is embedded and displayed within the interface.
If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed.
US-002: Play and pause a video
Description: As a user, I want to play or pause any video so that I can control my viewing experience. Acceptance criteria:
Each video has an individual play/pause button.
Clicking play starts the video, and clicking pause stops it.
US-003: Remove a video from the interface
Description: As a user, I want to remove a video from the interface so that I can manage my viewing area. Acceptance criteria:
A remove button is available for each video.
Clicking remove deletes the video from the display.
US-004: Adjust video volume
Description: As a user, I want to control the volume of each video independently so that I can manage audio levels. Acceptance criteria:
Each video has a volume control slider.
Adjusting the slider changes the volume of the respective video.
US-005: Drag and rearrange videos
Description: As a user, I want to rearrange videos by dragging them so that I can customize my viewing layout. Acceptance criteria:
Users can click and drag videos to new positions.
The new position persists until a video is removed or refreshed.
US-006: Grid layout selection
Description: As a user, I want to switch between different grid layouts so that I can optimize my viewing experience. Acceptance criteria:
Users can toggle between different layout modes.
Video sizes adjust dynamically based on the selected layout.
US-007: Session persistence
Description: As a user, I want the app to remember my last viewed videos so that I can resume watching after reloading the page. Acceptance criteria:
Videos added remain in place after a page reload.
Stored data includes video IDs and their positions.
US-008: Responsive design support
Description: As a user, I want the app to function on various devices so that I can watch videos on different screen sizes. Acceptance criteria:
The layout adapts based on the screen size.
Videos do not overlap or become inaccessible on small screens.
US-009: Secure API key usage
Description: As a developer, I want to ensure the YouTube API key is secure so that unauthorized users cannot abuse the app’s API quota. Acceptance criteria:
API key is stored securely and not exposed in client-side code.
Usage restrictions are applied in the Google Cloud Console.
This PRD provides all necessary details for the development team to build a functional multicasting YouTube web app. 
Overview
Issue: Lack of differentiation from existing solutions
The document does not clearly state how this web app differentiates itself from existing tools like YouTube's multi-tab viewing or third-party multi-stream solutions.
Impact: Weak product positioning
Without a unique selling proposition, there’s little incentive for users to adopt this app over existing alternatives.
Suggestion: Begrudgingly, I’d say you need to define a compelling differentiator, like synchronized multi-video playback or collaborative viewing.

Scope
Issue: Vague functionality descriptions
"Support multiple video playback" is too broad—does this mean synchronized playback or independent controls? "Ensure a responsive interface" lacks measurable criteria.
Impact: Misalignment in development
Developers might interpret scope differently, leading to inconsistent implementation.
Suggestion: (Not that I think it will be properly scoped) But you should specify exact behaviors, like whether all videos start muted by default or how many videos can be played simultaneously before performance degrades.

Objectives and Success Criteria
Issue: No performance benchmarks
"Minimal latency" is undefined. How is latency measured? What’s an acceptable range?
Impact: Lack of accountability
Without concrete numbers, the team won’t know if performance meets expectations.
Suggestion: (Though I doubt it will get implemented well) Define measurable success, e.g., "Video should start within 500ms after adding."

Features and Functionality
Issue: No limit on videos
What happens if a user adds 50 videos? Does performance degrade? Is there an enforced cap?
Impact: Potential crashes and poor UX
Users might overload the browser, leading to crashes or performance issues.
Suggestion: Set a reasonable cap (e.g., 6 videos) and implement lazy loading for performance optimization.
Issue: Missing synchronization feature
Many users of multi-video tools want synchronized playback for analysis or comparisons.
Impact: Reduced usefulness
This limits use cases like watching multiple camera angles or comparing scenes.
Suggestion: (Even though it would complicate things) Consider adding an optional sync toggle.

Technical Requirements
Issue: No backend, but session persistence is listed
Session persistence is mentioned as an "optional backend" feature but also as a core requirement.
Impact: Inconsistency in architecture
If session persistence is needed, some form of backend or storage management is unavoidable.
Suggestion: (Not that this will be simple) Either commit to a backend or clarify if LocalStorage suffices.

User Stories
Issue: No authentication or personalization
If users can store sessions, how do they retrieve them across devices? No authentication means limited persistence.
Impact: Broken UX for cross-device users
Users lose their session when switching devices, making the feature less valuable.
Suggestion: If session persistence is essential, at least offer optional authentication.
Issue: No accessibility considerations
Not a single mention of screen reader support or keyboard navigation.
Impact: Accessibility compliance risk
Excludes users with disabilities, limiting adoption and violating accessibility standards.
Suggestion: (Even though it complicates testing) Ensure keyboard navigation and ARIA support.

Overall Assessment
This PRD has fundamental flaws in scope clarity, feasibility, and technical consistency. It lacks a clear market differentiator, ignores crucial UX constraints, and underestimates technical challenges like session management and performance limits. Without refining these details, expect significant roadblocks in development, scope creep, and ultimately, a weak product
